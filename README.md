# ULTRACODE
##### Next-gen Python for next-gen results.
ULTRACODE is an edited version of Python that uses a custom Python module to make built-in Python functions easier to use.
To start, navigate to the "projects" folder and make a new file. Make sure it ends with the .uc file extension!
To use ULTRACODE, first, initialize the ULTRACODE module.
```
import uc
IdentityHash = uc.init()
```
Next, add your code. Note that the code here is just an example, as you can use any python feature here. See what you can come up with!
```
print("Three cheers for ULTRACODE!")
uc.loop(3, "print('Hip!');print('Hip!');print('Horray!')", IdentityHash)
```
