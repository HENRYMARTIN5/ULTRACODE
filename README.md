# Megacode - UNSTABLE RELEASE
Megacode is an edited version of Python that uses a custom Python module to make built-in Python functions easier to use.
To start, navigate to the main folder and make a new file. Make sure it ends with the .mc file extension!
To use Megacode, first, initialize the Megacode module.
```
import mc
IdentityHash = mc.init()
```
Next, add your code. Note that the code here is just an example, as you can use any python feature here. See what you can come up with!
QUICK TIP: All Megacode functions must have your identity hash as the last parameter.
```
print("Three cheers for Megacode!")
mc.loop(3, "print('Hip! Hip! Hooray!!!')", IdentityHash)
```
And, once you're ready, exit the Megacode script.
```
mc.exit(IdentityHash)
```
Finally, run the script, enter your filename, type 2, press enter, and your program will load. Voila!
