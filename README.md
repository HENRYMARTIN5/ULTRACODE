# ULTRACODE
### Next-gen Python for next-gen results.
ULTRACODE is an edited version of Python that uses a custom Python module to make built-in Python functions easier to use.
To start, navigate to the main folder and make a new file. Make sure it ends with the .uc file extension!
To use ULTRACODE, first, initialize the ULTRACODE module.
```
import uc
IdentityHash = uc.init()
```
Next, add your code. Note that the code here is just an example, as you can use any python feature here. See what you can come up with!
QUICK TIP: All ULTRACODE functions must have your identity hash as the last parameter.
```
print("Three cheers for ULTRACODE!")
uc.loop(3, "print('Hip! Hip! Hooray!!!')", IdentityHash)
```
And, once you're ready, exit the ULTRACODE script.
```
uc.exit(IdentityHash)
```
Finally, run the script, enter your filename, type 2, press enter, and your program will load. Voila!
